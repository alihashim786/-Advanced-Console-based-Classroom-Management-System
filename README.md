# Object Oriented Programming  Advanced Console based Classroom Management System
Thats a prompt based Classroom Management System Using C++ Object Oriented Concepts

This project implements a console-based classroom management system using C++ and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The system includes key functionalities such as user management, class organization, assignment management, submission and grading, gradebook handling, file management, notification system, and user interface interactions.

Features
    User Management: Handles users (teachers, students) with different roles using inheritance and polymorphism.
    Class Management: Create, update, delete classes, manage student rosters, and persist class data.
    Assignment Management: Create, update, and delete assignments with validation for deadlines.
    Submission & Grading: Manage assignment submissions and grading, with file handling for storing data.
    Gradebook: Calculate and update student grades, generate grade reports, and persist grade data.
    File Management: Handle file operations for assignments, submissions, and class materials.
    Notification System: Notify users about important updates and deadlines.
    User Interface: Console-based UI with error handling and persistence of user preferences.
    Data Persistence: Ensures all data (users, assignments, grades) are saved between program runs.
    Exception Handling: Handles runtime errors and ensures the system runs smoothly without crashes.
